# Plan's file table missing app/dashboard/today/meetings/page.tsx

## Problem Statement

The plan correctly identifies that `app/dashboard/today/meetings/page.tsx` needs to call `getOrganizationId()` and pass it to `MeetingsContent`. This is listed in Steps 7 and 8. However, the **Files Changed table** at the bottom of the plan does not include `app/dashboard/today/meetings/page.tsx`.

A developer following the Files Changed table as a checklist will miss this file.

## Findings

Plan's Files Changed table (current):
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app/dashboard/today/meetings/meetings-content.tsx` | Extra step — add `organizationId` prop |
| ← `app/dashboard/today/meetings/page.tsx` is MISSING from the table |

Steps 7 and 8 correctly list both files. The table is incomplete.

## Proposed Solution

Add `app/dashboard/today/meetings/page.tsx` to the Files Changed table with description: "Call `getOrganizationId()`, pass to `MeetingsContent`"

## Recommended Action

Update plan document to add the missing row to the Files Changed table. This is documentation only.

## Technical Details

**Affected:** `docs/plans/2026-05-18-fix-calendar-attach-organization-id-plan.md` — Files Changed table

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Files Changed table has 15 rows (currently 14)
- [ ] `app/dashboard/today/meetings/page.tsx` appears in table
